			<h3 id="benefits">THE BENEFITS OF A PARALEGAL</h3>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Cost Savings</li>
				<li>Quick Access to Specialized Teams</li>
				<li>Staffing Flexibility</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p>Cost Savings</p>
			<p>The use of outside legal specialists for a temporary increase in workload allows
			corporate legal departments to better manage costs. These resources allow in-house
			legal professionals the time to perform valuable high-level management and oversee
			key projects.</p>
			
			<p>Quick Access to Specialized Teams</p>
			<p>When you have projects that require a particular skill set, outside legal 
			professionals are a useful resource. An experienced project professional gives
			corporate legal departments immediate access to specialized knowledge, which is 
			particularly helpful if those skills are not available within the organization.</p>
			
			<p>Staffing Flexibility</p>
			<p>The flexibility provided by a mix of full-time staff and project professionals 
			allow organizations to conserve their in-house resources for priority 
			responsibilities while still meeting deadlines with quality work. In addition, the 
			use of temporary help prevents overhiring for increases in workload followed by
			reduction of staff when work levels return to normal.</p>
